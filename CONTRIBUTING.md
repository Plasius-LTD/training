# Contributing to @plasius/training

First off: thanks for taking the time to contribute.
This document explains how to work on the project, how to propose changes, and what we expect in pull requests.

> TL;DR
>
> - Be respectful and follow the Code of Conduct.
> - Open an issue before large changes; small fixes can go straight to a PR.
> - Write tests, keep coverage steady or improving.
> - Use Conventional Commits.
> - Don’t include real PII in code, issues, tests, or logs.

## How to propose a change

### 1) For bugs

- Search existing issues first.
- Open a new issue with:
  - Clear title, steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behaviour,
  - Minimal repro (code snippet or small repo),
  - Environment info (OS, Node, package version).

### 2) For features / refactors

- For anything non-trivial, open an issue first and outline the proposal.
- If the change affects public API or architecture, add an ADR draft (see `docs/adrs/`).

### 3) Good first issues

We label approachable tasks as **good first issue** and **help wanted**.

## Branch, commit, PR

**Branching**

- Fork or create a feature branch from `main`: `feat/xyz` or `fix/abc`.

**Commit messages** (Conventional Commits)

- `feat: add new exported helper`
- `fix: correct runtime edge-case`
- `docs: expand usage examples`
- `refactor: simplify package boundary`
- `test: add coverage for package contracts`
- `chore: bump dev deps`

**Pull Requests**

- Keep PRs focused and small when possible.
- Include tests for new or changed behaviour.
- Update docs (README, JSDoc, ADRs) as needed.
- Add a clear description of what and why, with before/after examples if useful.
- Ensure CI is green (lint, build, tests).

**PR checklist**

- [ ] Title uses Conventional Commits
- [ ] Tests added or updated
- [ ] Lint passes (`npm run lint`)
- [ ] Typecheck passes (`npm run typecheck` when defined)
- [ ] Build passes (`npm run build`)
- [ ] Docs updated (README, ADR, CHANGELOG if needed)
- [ ] No real PII in code, tests, or logs

## Coding standards

- **Language:** TypeScript with strict types where practical.
- **Style:** ESLint and repo standards.
- **Tests:** Prefer Vitest, and add focused coverage for exported behaviour.
- **Public API:** Aim for backward compatibility; use SemVer and mark breaking changes clearly (`feat!:` or `fix!:`).
- **Performance:** Avoid unnecessary allocations and excessive runtime coupling.
- **Docs:** Add concise TSDoc comments for exported types and functions when they add clarity.

---

## Adding dependencies

- Minimise runtime dependencies; prefer dev dependencies where possible.
- Justify any new runtime dependency in the PR description (size, security, maintenance).
- Avoid transitive heavy dependencies unless critical.

---

## Versioning & releases

- We follow **SemVer**.
- Breaking changes require a major bump and migration notes.
- Keep `CHANGELOG.md` clear about user-facing changes.

---

## Documentation

- Update `README.md` with new features or setup steps.
- Add or update ADRs in `docs/adrs/` for architectural decisions.
- Add or update TDRs and design notes when the package boundary or delivery plan changes.
- Keep examples minimal, copy-pasteable, and tested when feasible.

---

## Questions

If you have questions or want feedback before building:

- Open a discussion or issue with a short proposal.
- Or draft a PR early and mark it as **Draft** to get directional feedback.
